### [1.2.1] - 2025/11/30

### [1.1.1] - 2025/11/20
- Flipped the normals on the quad mesh so they're now facing the right way

### [1.1.0] - 2025/11/20
- The exported mesh parts are now quads (as opposed to empty meshes) this allows the ability to export in glTF format
- Added support for `scale` field in the `Bindings.captureUI` options to achieve parity with `captureViewport` 

### [1.0.2] - 2025/11/19

### [1.0.0] - 2025/11/19
- Outdated versions of photobooth now notify (in a non-intrusive way) that an update is available in the settings window.
- Breaking changes for the bindings module:
  - The module is now parent under a camera instance. This avoids replicating the bindings in a team create setting.
  - `captureViewport` and `captureUI` now return `nil` upon failure without throwing an unhelpful warn in the output window
  - `captureViewport` and `captureUI` now use an options table which allows for much more granularity over capture results.
  - Optional `alphaBleed` param can be used to override the user's alpha bleed setting.
  - Optional `scale` param can be used to better control how the camera adjusts for a capture when using a non-unit os scale.
